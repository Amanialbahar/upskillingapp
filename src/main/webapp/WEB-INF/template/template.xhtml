			<h2>Al-Hussein Technical University</h2>
			<p>Located in the King Hussein Business Park, Al Hussein Technical University (HTU) was established by the Crown Prince Foundation to
				bridge the gap between the number of graduates and their rate of employment in technical fields. To address this gap, the Crown Prince
				Foundation set forth HTU as a model of technical education that features a seamless combination of excellence, rigor, and close
				alignment to the ever-changing demands and developments of industry.</p>
			<p>HTU prepares students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education and training. Students earn their
				degrees through a combination of the finest theoretical instruction and the latest practical applications in new, state-of-the-art
				laboratories. In addition, HTU has formed close ties with the technical industry in Jordan, regionally, and internationally, resulting
				in mutually beneficial partnerships.</p>

				contributing to the talent pool of the IT sector in Jordan.Job-seeking graduates undertook 340 contact hours of intensive applied
				practical training at HTU which include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>100+ CONTACT HOURS FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMPONENT</li>
